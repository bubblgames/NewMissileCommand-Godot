# Missile Command

This project was started because of the STOP WAITING FOR GODOT game jam. It took me about 5 days to make a very basic version of Missile Command, and 10 more days to make it to a point where I'm proud of it. It was made with Godot and was meant to emulate the 1980 version of the arcade game
